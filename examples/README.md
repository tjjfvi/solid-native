# `solid-native` Example App

You can try out the app online [here](https://solid-native.t6.fyi/), using [Expo
Snack](https://github.com/expo/snack).

You can also run the app locally by [installing
Expo](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/) and running `npm start`
in this directory.

## [Counter](https://github.com/tjjfvi/solid-native/tree/sne/examples/src/examples/Counter)

Solid's [counter example](https://www.solidjs.com/examples/counter) rewritten in
`solid-native`.

## [Periodic](https://github.com/tjjfvi/solid-native/tree/sne/examples/src/examples/Periodic)

A variation on the Counter example, where the counters use a `Show` to display
periodically.

## [Todo](https://github.com/tjjfvi/solid-native/tree/sne/examples/src/examples/Todo)

This is simply Solid's [todo example](https://www.solidjs.com/examples/todos)
rewritten in `solid-native`.

It persists the todos you enter in `AsyncStorage` -- the asynchronous React
Native analog of `localStorage`.

## [Nested](https://github.com/tjjfvi/solid-native/tree/sne/examples/src/examples/Nested)

This shows `solid-native`'s Solid-React interop.
